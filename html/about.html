                        <p class="header">The Beginning</p>
                        <p>The summer of 2020, my wife and I decided that we were going to start a food truck together. We both love food and I have always wanted to start a business. We decided that we were going to sell Gelati. Gelati is a layered frozen dessert that consists of Italian Ice and custard in alternating layers. It looks something like this. </p>

                        <p class="header">Building the Food Truck</p>
                        <p>One of the big projects was building our food truck. It took a lot of work and we learned many skills (wiring lights, plumbing a water tank, installing rooftop AC units, etc.) After many weeks and countless man hours, our food truck was ready to go!</p>

                        <p class="header">Landing the Big Fish</p>
                        <p>With our trailer finished, we were able to start making product and working on our recipe. After our first batch we knew that we had something special. People were really liking it during our testing events. We decided that we would shoot for the stars and try to land a big contract that would lead to great exposure and sales opportunities. We pitched BYU football. Before our doors were ever open and before we made our first sale. It was the most nervewracking experience, standing before 10 people who could make the future of our business successful. Thankfully, they liked our product as much as other people did and we have already had a wonderful first year with the BYU Football program. </p>
